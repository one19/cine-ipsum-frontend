# STANDARD FRONTEND REPO

I'm fucking tired of making new ones of these. Let's just get this bad boy up to speed and working for maximum usability. Below are a series of tasks that will make starting up new projects much easier:

### TODO
1. firebase provider
2. Make a recurrent task to keep deps updated
3. Swap in docz
4. qul
5. glitter
6. really good automagic styles
7. flow
8. script that:
  a. strips the script
  b. clones the repo into the named folder
  c. replaces the appname wherever it's used
